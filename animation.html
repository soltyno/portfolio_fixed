                <p class="portfolio-box-text-3">This theme contained both individual and group productions.
                    The main goal was to create a few interactive animations with an interactive story with focus on
                    the story,
                    a style, character design, animations and interactivity designed for a specific target
                    group. I had to use my skills in sketching, hand drawing and then drawing visual universe and
                    characters in illustrator. I have learned about animation principles which I used later and I had
                    to expand my skills in HTML and CSS as well, because I had to add SVG files and audio elements to
                    the site as well as use advanced selectors, transitions, keyframe animations, querySelector, events
                    & eventListeners and so on.
                    Despite the fact that it was a bit difficult I really enjoyed this theme.

                        fantasy in a creation of a story, skills in Illustrator as well as in coding and
                        all of that with good design thinking. All of that we had to put into the document
                        that included sketched story board and character, backgrounds with character draw
                        in Illustrator, worksheet, narrative curve and so on. At the end we had to code a
                        small part of a story with Javascript and CSS. This part of an assignment was so interesting
                        for me that it become a challenge for me to finish the whole story. It was really big
                        project and it would be a pity for me not to finish it. It took me some time but I’m proud
                        on my work and I’m glad that I decided like I decided because I gained valuable skills
                        in Javascript which I’m using until now. Besides that I improved it by adding few more
                        animations to the story, so I could put it as a project “Simple animation” from previously task.</p>

                    We did it in pairs by choosing projects from project pool and making them on our own. We decided to
                    make a
                    minigame “Smash the fly” but a bit more funny, interesting and difficult way. First 5 second of the
                    game
                    we put changing fly’s position when you hover on the fly which means you can’t actually smash the
                    fly. However,
                    after 5 seconds it was normal and you was able to do it as in the project pool.</p>

                <p class="animation-text">With improved skills in javascript and story creating,
                    it was time to put my knowledge to use. We formed a group and were given a style, in
                    which we should design our story, which we will later code using javascript and css
                    animations. I was part of design team, so I made most of the illustrations of our character
                    and environment, in the blue note style. I limited the color palette and tried to make
                    everything simple and straight forward.</p>
