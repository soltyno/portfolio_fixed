          The main goal was to create a few interactive animations with an interactive story with focus on the story,
            a style, character design, animations and interactivity designed for a specific target
            group. I had to use my skills in sketching, hand drawing and then drawing visual universe and 
            characters in illustrator. I have learned about animation principles which I used later and I had 
            to expand my skills in HTML and CSS as well, because I had to add SVG files and audio elements to
             the site as well as use advanced selectors, transitions, keyframe animations, querySelector, events & eventListeners and so on.
             Despite the fact that it was a bit difficult I really enjoyed this theme.

                <div class="fs15 logo-text">
                    <p>Eagles have always been considered as the kings of the sky. They fly
                        higher than any other birds, which inspire us to reach higher and become more than you think
                        you are capable of. Because of the Eagle’s ability to fly so high yet stay grounded, they’re
                        great at global thinking. The Eagle is looking closely with a careful eye at the most minute of
                        details in order to see life from a broader perspective. They see more than the average human
                        and their perspective from the sky provides solutions that others cannot see. They see into the
                        past, present, and future.
                        The Eagle’s vision is 8 times greater than humans and contain many more color-sensitive cones.
                        They take a look from where it sees and soar into unknown realms and new realities -
                        continually expanding their view.<br><br>
                        They have exceptionally strong talons which are symbolic of the ability to grab what you need
                        and have feet with four toes as a symbol for having a solid foundation. They have powers of
                        intuition, creativity and perception. Eagle symbolism can also mean that there are
                        opportunities available to you and that you must snatch them up while they last.</p>

                        have chosen Montserrat as a font as it seems to me elegant and pure like an Eagle and my whole
                        website.

            <div class="usability-text">
                <p>My usability test was asking five people to answer following questions by looking at my webpage.
                    <br><br>
                    • What is the page about?<br>
                    • How can you tell in which page are you?<br>
                    • Where can you find my personal information?<br>
                    • Is it hard to read some text for you?<br>
                    • Do you have some problem with switching between pages?<br>
                    • Where can you find information about my logo?<br>
                    <br>
                    This test gave me mostly positive results. Everything from my question was easy to answer and
                    everyone have any difficulties with looking for the information. When I asked them if they have
                    some suggestions to improve functionality of my website a was given advice to make my navigaiton
                    bar fixed and then adjust color of the navigation panel, so they don’t have to scroll back to top.
                    <br><br>
                    So my future plan about this website is to make fixed navigation panel and also add further
                    information about my website and about me. Also my plan is to reduce numbers of colors on my
                    website, so there will be more simplicity in colors. </p>
