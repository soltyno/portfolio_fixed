                    techniques. I was expected to work in several different teams during this

                <p class="portfolio-box-text-3">This theme contained both individual and group productions.
                    The main goal was to create a few interactive animations with an interactive story with focus on
                    the story,
                    a style, character design, animations and interactivity designed for a specific target
                    group. I had to use my skills in sketching, hand drawing and then drawing visual universe and
                    characters in illustrator. I have learned about animation principles which I used later and I had
                    to expand my skills in HTML and CSS as well, because I had to add SVG files and audio elements to
                    the site as well as use advanced selectors, transitions, keyframe animations, querySelector, events
                    & eventListeners and so on.
                    Despite the fact that it was a bit difficult I really enjoyed this theme.

                    solutions for smartphones so that my work is based on specific insights about actual

                    we could easily say our ideas and chose the best one. My role in this project was to create a

                    we were discussing every move, so everyone could say his opinion. </p>

                    life.
