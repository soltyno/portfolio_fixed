                    The main goal was to create a few interactive animations with an interactive story with focus on
                    the story,
                    a style, character design, animations and interactivity designed for a specific target
                    group. I had to use my skills in sketching, hand drawing and then drawing visual universe and
                    characters in illustrator. I have learned about animation principles which I used later and I had
                    to expand my skills in HTML and CSS as well, because I had to add SVG files and audio elements to
                    the site as well as use advanced selectors, transitions, keyframe animations, querySelector, events
                    & eventListeners and so on.
                    Despite the fact that it was a bit difficult I really enjoyed this theme.

                    apply all our ideas. Design sprint was new to me and I liked the idea that everyone has the same
                    right. However, our design sprint was a bit adjusted in the meaning that it looked more friendly
                    and unprofessional, and we didn't use stickers for voting for everything, but I think it's normal
                    as we were only five students doing it for the first time. I think that we did well in this
                    assignment
                    and everyone from a group is satisfied about the results.</p>

                last week by doing Design Sprint, so researching, brainstorming, putting our ideas on the wall,
                deciding, sketching, interviewing and after all prototyping the final app in XD. Design Sprint was
                without any problems as we were already familiar with it and prototyping was easy for us as well.
                However, in this assignment, we learn how to use UI kits in XD, so our prototype would look more
                realistic for users of iOS or Android devices.</p>

                and at the same time a lot more that I expected. Of course, there are some things and situations
                that I don’t like so much but these bright sides significantly outweigh dark sides. I liked the
                whole content of the 1. Semester, especially animations part, where I finally learned more about
                Javascript what was my wish for a long time. In addition, I greatly expanded my knowledge and skills in
                many different areas, so I consider this “little” 4 months experience as a very valuable and beneficial.</p>
